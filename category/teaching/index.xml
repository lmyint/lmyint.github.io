      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grading doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to suck—for teachers or for students. Two books on grading have inspired me to adopt a reinvigorated mindset towards grading and feedback: &lt;em&gt;Specifications Grading&lt;/em&gt; by Linda Nilson and &lt;em&gt;Grading for Equity&lt;/em&gt; by Joe Feldman. In this post, I want to summarize key ideas from both books and share my thought process for course preparation that incorporates the essential parts of both frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;table-of-contents&#34;&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#why-change&#34;&gt;Why change grading systems?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#specs-grading&#34;&gt;Specifications Grading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#equity-grading&#34;&gt;Grading for Equity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#blending-frameworks&#34;&gt;Blending the two frameworks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-change-grading-systems-the-beast-that-is-traditional-grading-a-idwhy-changea&#34;&gt;Why change grading systems? The beast that is traditional grading &lt;a id=&#34;why-change&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I used a traditional points-based grading system in my courses: points for homework, exams, and projects, all under some weighting scheme to determine the overall course grade. Grading always brought about negative emotions for me at every stage of the process—the anticipation of it, the act of actually doing it, and reflecting on grades that I had assigned. This negativity generally stemmed from five sources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grading always took up so much time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disputes with students about points were always disheartening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was disappointed that grades sometimes reflected students&#39; understanding poorly—both overestimating and underestimating their understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was disappointed at seeing the same mistakes over and over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was worried about the stress that my students were feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of habit I dismissed these woes as necessary evils of my job, but after reading &lt;em&gt;Specifications Grading&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grading for Equity&lt;/em&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt inspired to reach for something better. In the next two sections, I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize the specifications and equity grading frameworks. I&amp;rsquo;ll end with some course preparation thoughts that combine both frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;specifications-grading-a-idspecs-gradinga&#34;&gt;Specifications Grading &lt;a id=&#34;specs-grading&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-key-components-specs-and-rubrics&#34;&gt;Two key components: specs and rubrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;specification&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;spec&lt;/strong&gt; for short) is a requirement that an instructor sets for a piece of student work. In a specifications grading system, all assessments of course learning objectives have a set of specs that are each graded on a pass/fail scale. For a given assessment, &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; specs must be passed in order for the assignment as a whole to receive a passing grade. With this pass/fail evaluation, it is essential that instructors provide a very clear rubric of what it means to earn a pass for a given spec. For example, I might ask students to create a captioned data visualization that shows the relationship between two variables in a dataset. The specs and rubrics for a passing grade could be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spec 1: Visualization must be correct and well-labeled.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rubric: Visualization must&amp;hellip;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the appropriate type for the given variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have axis labels with units and full words (as opposed to coded variable names)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spec 2: Caption must correctly describe the visualization with appropriate numerical summary measures.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rubric: Caption must&amp;hellip;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss the strength and direction of the relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use appropriate numerical summaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mapping-assessment-grades-to-course-grades&#34;&gt;Mapping assessment grades to course grades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine final course grades, instructors can link letter grades to desired combinations of passed assessments. For example, to earn an A students must pass 9 out of the 10 course assignments or must pass a specific set of the 10 assignments. This approach to determining a final course grade is called the &lt;strong&gt;bundling approach&lt;/strong&gt;—bundles of passed assignments translate to a letter grade**.** (Another approach that assigns points to passed assessments is discussed in Chapter 6 of *Specifications Grading*. However, in alignment with the equity grading framework discussed later, I&amp;rsquo;m not an advocate of this **point system approach**.) The bundling approach has transparency advantages for both instructors and students. Instructors can look at a letter grade and know exactly what students understand. Students know exactly what they must to to earn a given letter grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-specs-grading&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of specs grading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pass/fail grading of specifications and assessments (with sufficiently clear rubrics) is intended to produce the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving time for teachers: The lack of partial credit avoids time-consuming deliberations over points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing rigor: Setting high standards for a pass encourages higher quality work than a points-based system with partial credit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased consistency of grades between students: Rubrics for pass/fail grades should be resistant to biases that plague finer scales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High clarity and transparency:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instructors: With bundling, a letter indicates exactly what students understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For students: Rubrics and grade bundles tell students exactly what they need to do to succeed, which can motivate them to aim higher than they would have normally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some potential downsides of specs grading include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing sufficiently clear rubrics can be very time-consuming the first time. However, this initial time investment should translate to time savings during the course and its future offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students may be resistant to a new grading system without partial credit. Instructors will need to devote time to communicating why they are using a specs grading system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the downsides of specs grading are well worth its benefits. As we&amp;rsquo;ll see next, many of its benefits align with an equity-oriented grading framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;grading-for-equity-a-idequity-gradinga&#34;&gt;Grading for Equity &lt;a id=&#34;equity-grading&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pillars-of-the-framework&#34;&gt;Pillars of the framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An equity grading system is rooted in three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grades must be mathematically accurate:&lt;/strong&gt; The final number or letter grade given to students must accurately reflect their understanding of course concepts by the end of the course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grades must be bias-resistant:&lt;/strong&gt; As much as possible, grades must be free from the influence of the instructor&amp;rsquo;s implicit biases and the student&amp;rsquo;s life circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grades must be motivational:&lt;/strong&gt; Grades should inspire students to learn and excel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Grading for Equity&lt;/em&gt;, Joe Feldman proposes several concrete course policies that support these pillars. Throughout, he builds from the central tenet that &lt;strong&gt;grades should accurately reflect students&#39; understanding of course content and nothing else&lt;/strong&gt;. In the rest of this section, I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize his proposed policies and how they connect to these three pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoid-assigning-zeroes-by-using-a-minimum-grading-policy&#34;&gt;Avoid assigning zeroes by using a minimum grading policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In points-based grading systems, many instructors assign zero points to assessments that are late, incomplete, or fraudulent as a means of deterring and punishing undesirable behavior. A more equitable points-based system avoids assigning zeroes. One policy that Feldman proposes for this is &lt;strong&gt;minimum grading&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a policy that assigns a standard nonzero grade (say, 40 out of 100 points) where the instructor would normally give a zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Particularly on 100 point scales, zeroes have a disproportionate effect on point averages that are commonly used to determine final grades. In this way, assigning zeroes substantially underestimates student understanding. Further, a zero is inherently dubious as it signals that a student has absolutely no knowledge of a topic, which is highly unlikely. Minimum grading can help rectify the sensitivity of grades to outlier zeroes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Seeing a zero can be utterly demotivating to a student. Often times, recovering from one or more zeroes requires an extraordinary amount of effort (if it is possible at all), and this can extinguish any flicker of a growth mindset. Minimum grading can help sustain student optimism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since thinking about specifications grading frameworks, I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of points-based grading systems, so I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to use these the no-zero or minimum grading policies. However, I think they are worth considering for instructors who prefer points-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-a-0-4-scale&#34;&gt;Use a 0-4 scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Points-based grading systems often use 100-point or similarly fine-grained scales to evaluate student work. A coarser (e.g., 0-4) scale can help make grades more equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Fine scales are subject to considerable variability. Even with a rubric, an instructor could easily reread the same work and assign slightly different scores each time. A coarse 0-4 scale promotes accuracy and consistency of grades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): Because scores given on fine scales have more room to vary, they are more subject to instructors&#39; implicit biases. Coarser scales allow instructors to follow rubrics with greater consistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0-4 scale policy very closely aligns with the specifications grading approach. The specs grading approach takes coarse scales to the extreme by essentially proposing a 0-1 scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;weigh-recent-performance-more-than-early-performance&#34;&gt;Weigh recent performance more than early performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, instructors include all student attempts to show understanding of a concept in the course grade. Instead, they should weigh latest student performance more heavily. At the extreme, &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; the most recent assessments of a skill count toward the grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Grades should reflect student understanding of material by the end of the course—not how quickly students reached that level of understanding. Thus, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to include grades for the early stage of the learning process. By weighing recent performance more heavily, grades more accurately reflect student understanding by the end of the course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): Students who have more difficult life circumstances might take longer to grasp concepts and would have lower grades under a traditional system that evaluates during the learning process. Weighing recent performance more heavily allows these struggling students the extra time they need to show the same level of understanding as their more privileged peers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Giving less weight to (and perhaps not even counting) early performance can inspire a growth mindset in students—particularly those who initially struggle. Without early struggles pulling the grade down, students can optimistically work toward genuine improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy relates closely to a &lt;strong&gt;retakes and redos&lt;/strong&gt; policy described later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoid-assigning-grades-for-the-product-of-group-work&#34;&gt;Avoid assigning grades for the product of group work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of grading the product of group work, instructors should evaluate students individually after the group work is complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Group work tends to reflect the work of the strongest group members. Applying the group grade to individual students will overestimate the understanding of struggling students. With this policy, students can still benefit from collaboration, but the grades assigned will actually reflect individual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): When students must demonstrate their learning individually, they are more motivated to do the necessary work than when falling back on group members is possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If group work is solely meant to provide enriching learning experiences for students, then the framework of &lt;a href=&#34;https://complexinstruction.stanford.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;complex instruction&lt;/a&gt; is worth thinking about. I&amp;rsquo;ll say a bit more about complex instruction at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoid-incorporating-extra-credit-into-the-grade&#34;&gt;Avoid incorporating extra credit into the grade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructors award extra credit for a wide variety of activities. These activities can be course-related, but often times they are not. Extra credit violates all 3 pillars of equitable grading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): In the worst case that extra credit has nothing to do with course content (e.g., bringing in materials for the class), grades become a nonsensical mix of content knowledge and participation in these extracurricular activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): Instructors tend to offer extra credit for activities that require an appreciable amount of time outside of class, expose students to new ideas, or offer a good challenge. Struggling students and students whose life circumstances preclude extra time to devote to schoolwork will tend to not take extra credit opportunities. It ends up being exactly the students who do not need extra credit who end up getting it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Students who tend to be unable to participate in extra credit opportunities can feel demotivated knowing about these missed opportunities. Further, whether related to course content or not, extra credit demotivates true learning by incentivizing the accumulation of points. If students view any earned points equally (whether they come from extra credit or the assessments of course content), then including extra credit derails learning of the primary material that instructors truly care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-alternative-non-grade-consequences-for-late-work-and-cheating&#34;&gt;Use alternative (non-grade) consequences for late work and cheating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common to deduct points for late work and for academic integrity violations (on top of school-mandated punishments for integrity violations). These point loss policies embody a punishment system focused on &lt;strong&gt;deterrence&lt;/strong&gt; of and &lt;strong&gt;retribution&lt;/strong&gt; for bad behaviors. Feldman advocates instead for a &lt;strong&gt;rehabilitation&lt;/strong&gt;-centered system: students have a chance to turn in late work without a grade penalty and to repeat the work on which they cheated, as opposed to losing points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Deducting points for late work mixes the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of student performance into a grade that should only reflect the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of student performance. Deducting points for cheating results in a number that does not reflect a student&amp;rsquo;s knowledge. By definition, work that is copied does not represent a student&amp;rsquo;s understanding and deserves a missing or NA grade. This further underscores the merits of rehabilitative punishment—having students repeat the work on which they cheated is the only way to observe their true understanding and fill in the missing grade with an accurate one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): Grade consequences for late work tend to affect more vulnerable students. These students might have significant time commitments outside of school that make it difficult to hand in work on time. These difficult personal circumstances can also explain why students cheat: with a grading system that harshly punishes lateness, they feel that there is no other way to complete or succeed on the assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Grade consequences for late work and cheating can result in a vicious cycle: the demotivation resulting from the grade punishments results in further late work and cheating in desperate attempts to catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;exclude-participation-and-effort-from-the-grade&#34;&gt;Exclude &amp;ldquo;participation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;effort&amp;rdquo; from the grade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Participation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;effort&amp;rdquo; categories within the course grade broadly encompass desirable behaviors that the instructor wants to encourage (e.g., speaking in class discussions, contributing to group work, asking questions, attempting assignments). Including such categories results in inequitable grades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Grades should reflect students&#39; understanding of course content. &amp;ldquo;Participation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;effort&amp;rdquo; indicate nothing about this understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): The components of &amp;ldquo;participation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;effort&amp;rdquo; that instructors decide to include in the grade arise completely from their values. These values generally reflect a very narrow view of what it takes to be academically successful. Students who do not fit this narrow mold end up suffering despite their understanding of the course material. Further, there may be cultural reasons (school culture, classroom culture, etc.) underlying lack of participation from some students. Grade penalties for non-participation can perpetuate cycles of negative outcomes for certain groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): The same problems arising from Pillar 2 can result in demotivation and a loss of faith in the learning system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-only-summative-assessments-in-the-grade-not-formative-assessments&#34;&gt;Use only summative assessments in the grade, not formative assessments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is effectively a &amp;ldquo;No homework in the grade&amp;rdquo; policy. This may seem controversial to instructors and perhaps terrifying to students (&amp;ldquo;100% of the grade is exams!?&amp;quot;), but coupled with a policy of offering retakes (described below), this can be a part of an equitable grading framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 1 (Mathematical accuracy): Formative assessments, like homework, are meant for students to &lt;strong&gt;practice&lt;/strong&gt; their understanding. They should be a source of feedback but not a source of evaluation. To include formative assessment scores in the final grade would result in an inaccurate representation of students&#39; ultimate understanding because these assessments are part of students&#39; learning &lt;strong&gt;journey&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 2 (Resistance to bias): Grading homework for correctness can have disproportionately negative effects on the most vulnerable students who may lack the time to complete homework due to weaker understanding and/or external commitments. For fear of losing points, they may not attempt the homework or resort to copying. Both acts prevent them from practicing the material, which was the main goal of homework in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;renaming-grades&#34;&gt;Renaming grades&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using a 0-4 or A-F scale, instructors can use short descriptors. Example: Exceeding Standards, Meeting Standards, Approaching Standards, Not Yet Met Standards, Insufficient Evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Renaming grades in this way can clarify expectations for each grade level, dispel the tendency for students to over-judge themselves based on grades, and prompt students to think about grades guiding their learning as part of a growth mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;retakes-and-redos&#34;&gt;Retakes and redos&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly allow students to learn from their mistakes, instructors should give students the opportunity to retake portions of summative assessments that indicate room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pillar 3 (Motivation): Having the opportunity to try again can alleviate some students&#39; testing anxiety and show them that their instructors truly care about their growth. This can motivate students to aim higher than they would have normally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blending-the-two-frameworks-in-course-preparation-a-idblending-frameworksa&#34;&gt;Blending the two frameworks in course preparation &lt;a id=&#34;blending-frameworks&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss policies that I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted and questions that I ask myself when preparing a course that uses a specs-equity grading system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iterate-between-writing-learning-objectives-and-assessments&#34;&gt;Iterate between writing learning objectives and assessments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never been organized enough to write all of my assessments before the start of the course, but in implementing a specs-equity grading system, I think it would be useful to draft assessments in parallel with writing learning objectives for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can help me identify &amp;ldquo;implicit&amp;rdquo; skills that I have not expressed as an explicit learning objective. A common example in my courses is the ability to recognize which of many concepts or tools is most useful for a given problem. By writing learning objectives and assessments in tandem, I could more easily recognize that &amp;ldquo;Identify relevant tools&amp;rdquo; should be its own learning objective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drafting assessments early also prompts me to draft rubrics early. Although this front-loads a lot of work, this should result in a more manageable workload during the semester.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having early assessment drafts helps me shape my course schedule, which in turn guides my thinking on the type and timing of metacognitive activities for my students. This helps me decide if I want dedicated learning objectives for metacognition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bundling-to-determine-the-course-grade&#34;&gt;Bundling to determine the course grade&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bundling approach, students must pass a particular set of assessments to earn a particular final course grade. If crafting assessments such that each assessment targets one learning objective, this amounts to each course grade being linked to mastery of a specific set of concepts. In my opinion, bundling (rather than assigning points to passed assessments) is the optimal way to use specs grading to determine course grades for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For one, the transparency of knowing exactly what concepts need to be understood to earn each letter grade is beneficial for both me and my students. I like being able to communicate to colleagues and potential future employers exactly what a student understood from my course. Students like having clear expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further, bundling can serve as a great signal to the most important ideas in the course. If the objectives that need to be mastered for a D are a subset of those required for a C (and so forth), students can clearly see that the objectives required for a D are crucial concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;renaming-passfail-scores&#34;&gt;Renaming pass/fail scores&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encourage a growth mindset, I prefer to rename pass/fail scores to Meets Standards (MS) and Not Yet Meeting Standards (NY).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-assessments-to-use&#34;&gt;What assessments to use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quizzes and exams
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In some courses, there are concepts that are so fundamental that they need to top of mind (e.g., knowing the appropriate types of data visualizations to make for the variables of interest). Are there enough of these concepts that warrant regular, timed, in-class exams?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I prefer more frequent quizzes to a couple of large exams because frequent quizzes provide numerous retake opportunities, which can reduce testing anxiety. Later quizzes can include questions on earlier learning objectives that only need to be completed by students who have not yet mastered the concept. To manage time constraints, quiz questions on current content can be designed to only take, say, half of the class period. The hope is that the other half of the class period is sufficient for students pursuing retakes to finish the associated parts of the quiz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Grading for Equity&lt;/em&gt;, Joe Feldman notes that retakes are only equitable if they are mandatory—the most vulnerable students might be reluctant to choose to pursue a retake opportunity for a variety of reasons. My takeaway from this is that instructors should strongly consider any potentially beneficial activity to be mandatory in order to promote equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homework
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the role of homework? If using quizzes and/or exams, is the purpose of homework primarily to practice for these summative assessments? If so, I&amp;rsquo;m in favor of Joe Feldman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;no formative assessments in the grade&amp;rdquo; policy. Providing full solutions and offering formative feedback for the most crucial exercises should be enough to help students learn and practice, but excluding them from the grade can relieve students&#39; time pressures and anxieties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from traditional problem sets, I have also tried writing-intensive assignments which required students to explain statistical concepts in their own words. I was comfortable including this type of homework in the grade because they comprised a semester-long assignment that had flexible deadlines and constant opportunities for revision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If students begin projects towards the end of the course, grading them on a pass/fail scale can cause stress for students because of the shorter amount of time available for feedback. Clear specifications for good work are always necessary, but in this case a finer scale than a pass/fail scale might be necessary. This can still form a part of a bundling approach to determining the course grade: each letter grade is associated with a minimum project grade—in addition to a required set of learning objectives to have mastered by the end of the course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the project spans the entire course and students are able to start early, a fully specs grading approach is completely feasible. Project milestones can be graded on a pass/fail scale with the opportunity to revise non-passing milestones throughout the course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-role-of-group-work-in-the-course&#34;&gt;What is the role of group work in the course?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active learning in groups is a major part of class time in my courses. In place of a lecture, students watch videos and/or complete readings before class. During class, they work on exercises in groups to practice the ideas from the pre-class material. Overall, my students have appreciated this opportunity to practice and ask questions while I am present to help and classmates are there to collaborate. However, this style of learning can be challenging for some students who prefer different ways of learning or who don&amp;rsquo;t develop a good rapport with group members. For these reasons, I have started to consider the framework of &lt;a href=&#34;https://complexinstruction.stanford.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;complex instruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex instruction is a style of pedagogy that centers group work through the use of &amp;ldquo;groupworthy&amp;rdquo; tasks—tasks that truly require varied mindsets, opinions, and skills. While some students have found it helpful to be in groups to talk through the concepts prompted by my in-class exercises, there is nothing truly groupworthy about the exercises—nothing that truly necessitates diverse mindsets and skills. Although I have been guilty of using group projects rather than individual projects to cut down on my workload, I would like to be more intentional about group work in my courses going forward. Complex instruction captures exactly what I want in group work: the opportunity for students to engage in meaningful tasks together to promote better learning for everyone. Alana Unfried&amp;rsquo;s talks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots20/breakouts/1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ECOTS 2020&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=&#34;https://causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots21/keynote/3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;USCOTS 2021&lt;/a&gt; are excellent resources for learning more about complex instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-a-idsummarya&#34;&gt;Summary &lt;a id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifications grading brings to the table the specific practice of creating pass/fail criteria for student work. When used throughout a course, this framework can lead to heightened clarity for instructors and students. This benefits instructors with time savings during grading and improvements in communication about student understanding. This benefits students by making clear what they need to do to succeed, which can motivate them to aim higher. The pass fail nature of specifications grading naturally pairs with the policy offering retakes on assessments, which is a core part of an equitable grading approach. Feldman&amp;rsquo;s equity grading approach builds on this to encourage thinking more broadly about student motivation, the role of instructors&#39; implicit biases and of student&amp;rsquo;s life circumstances in grading practices, and the accuracy of grades in reflecting students&#39; ultimate understanding. Considering the implementation of these practices in our courses can lead to better outcomes for both students and instructors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is likelihood?</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am currently a TA for an introductory biostatistics sequence at JHSPH where we teach students about the essentials of regression analysis. A great question that came up at office hours last week was, “What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; likelihood?” I love this question because it is so fundamental to statistical thought, seems very intuitive, but actually abounds in nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my answer to the question to be rather unsatisfying: “Likelihood refers to how probable our collected data would be given the regression model that we’re currently fitting. The higher the likelihood that Stata reports, the more likely it is that we observe our data under the specified regression model.” Still not seeing the click, I added, “So essentially the higher the likelihood, the better the model is at fitting, at predicting the data. We’re using likelihood here as a means of measuring the predictive power of a regression model.” Some nodding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about this more, and the standard explanation of likelihood as being “under a certain model” is rather confusing. At least phrased in this way. Students are actually quite familiar with this idea in other settings. So if I could go back and answer the question again, I would want the conversation to go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; likelihood?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good question! Let me ask you this: what’s the probability of rolling a one on a six-sided die?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One-sixth…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ah - what if I told you that it was actually 90%?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence or contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So why did you say one-sixth?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because there’s a single one out of the six sides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right - so you assumed a &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; of a fair die. And using a model for a fair die, each number has a one-sixth chance of being rolled. I assumed a model of an exquisitely crafted loaded die where the chance of getting a one is 90% and the other five numbers is 2% each.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ok…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re getting close to the meat of it! So I have a model in mind, and you have a model in mind…who’s right? The only way to hope to answer this is with data. Say I rolled this hypothetical die and got a 2, 3, 4, 6, and then a 2. What die model do you think is better?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fair one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right - why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There wasn’t even a single one rolled, and your loaded die is supposed to have a 90% chance to roll a one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Excellent! So the &lt;strong&gt;likelihood&lt;/strong&gt; of our data is higher for the fair die than for my loaded die, which is what led you to prefer the fair die model. Specifically you can calculate the likelihood of the data under your fair die model as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5\)&lt;/span&gt;, and I can calculate the likelihood of the data under my loaded die model as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((0.02)^5\)&lt;/span&gt;, which is way lower. We can apply the thinking for this scenario analogously to regression! In regression, we are proposing models for the data just like we were in this dice scenario. It’s just that we’re using a different probability model. Specifically, we assume that the outcomes come from a normal distribution and that the mean of the distribution is some linear combination of covariates. Knowing the covariate information for everyone in our data is just like knowing the sequence of die rolls, and knowing the density function for the normal distribution is just like knowing the probabilities for the six sides of the die!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last bit of this would vary depending on the student’s understanding of the assumptions and setup of linear regression, but I like this line of explanation more than my original one for two teaching strategies that it employs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting the student up to be contradicted.&lt;/strong&gt; Arguably lessons are more memorable for students when they are fairly confident in an answer but end up being told otherwise. Here I wanted to make them think intuitively about a common situation but bring to light their unconscious assumptions by bringing in unusual but plausible assumptions of my own. One of the main points of the explanation, the key dependence of likelihood on the model being proposed, hinges on this awareness of the connection between having a model in mind and being able to calculate probabilities. So making this memorable is key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Framing the unfamiliar in the familiar.&lt;/strong&gt; Abstract concepts are often so because students are not accustomed to the language that we instructors are using to describe them. However, by framing the concept in a familiar context, students can more easily make the leap. It’s also a nice way to explain something twice without just repeating yourself twice. Essentially, analogies are the way to go when explaining something complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Teaching real math with computers</title>
      <link>/post/teaching-real-math-with-computers/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 17:03:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/teaching-real-math-with-computers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As per a friend’s suggestion, I watched Conrad Wolfram’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;TED talk&lt;/a&gt; on reforming mathematics education. He advocates increased use of computers in the classroom and, in particular, champions the idea of teaching math via programming. There were a lot of ideas both in and missing from his talk that I found interesting to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mathematics-can-be-taught-via-programming&#34;&gt;Mathematics can be taught via programming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wolfram points to the procedural and algorithmic nature of mathematics to say that a fuller understanding of mathematics can be achieved by having students write programs that implement concepts. I completely agree that if you truly understand a concept, you can program it, but it’s worthwhile trying to consider how this might actually play out in middle and high school curricula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to think about why this was such an interesting idea to many people in the first place. (It did get a TED talk after all.) The main point is that programming is not something that most people have any real idea of until they try it. I really didn’t understand what programming was about until I took an introductory class in college. I ended up loving it because I enjoyed the thorough and organized type of thinking that it encouraged, and I saw how useful it could be. People who are programmers or use programming regularly, like Mr. Wolfram, are very much convinced of its utility and are naturally excited about introducing this type of thinking earlier on in the education process. There are a few points that came to mind when weighing the pros and cons of a programming-oriented mathematics education:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-can-be-a-great-way-to-reinforce-concepts&#34;&gt;Programming can be a great way to &lt;strong&gt;reinforce&lt;/strong&gt; concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember learning how to solve the tower of Hanoi puzzle in the children’s section of museums and in puzzle games long before I saw it again in my freshman year programming class. If placed before me, I probably would have been able to go through the motions from rough recollections or intuition, but the task at hand was to write a program that would solve an arbitrary tower of Hanoi puzzle (i.e. with any number of discs). Suddenly rough intuition needed to be transformed into a precise set of instructions, and it was the fact that I was seeing a familiar problem recast in a more general way that made the exercise relevant and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With standard pre-college mathematics education, a similar strategy could be adopted. As a specific example, solving systems of two equations with two unknowns is a standard algebra topic that could benefit from programming-type exercises. After students learn the technique of solving these problems, they hone their skills on practice problems and ideally are able to develop intuition on how to solve them by sight. Making this intuition more precise is where a programming exercise could come in. After students gain facility with solving the problems, we have them make their understanding more rigorous by asking them to write a very specific set of instructions to solve any such system of equations. Suddenly they must think about how &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; they choose the scaling numbers for the equations and how they choose to add or subtract the two equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;programming-is-probably-not-the-best-way-to-introduce-a-topic&#34;&gt;Programming is probably not the best way to &lt;strong&gt;introduce&lt;/strong&gt; a topic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because an activity truly assesses understanding doesn’t mean that it automatically lays the foundation for a lesson plan. If all of my algebra lessons had been formatted as a series of instructions in the way that a programming perspective would emphasize, I know I would have enjoyed my math class a lot less. And I definitely would not have been ready to write a program to solve arbitrary systems of equations the day the topic was introduced. When material is presented as formulaic, as a procedure, students are compelled to simply memorize the steps involved in solving problems. The intuition is removed, and the concepts don’t stick past the next test. I still think that teachers should strive to motivate the material as much as possible—whether that be through telling a story or getting students to see how useful the concept can be. This is important in both a classroom instructional setting and in a homework design setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-features-of-programming-can-be-useful-for-structuring-material&#34;&gt;Some features of programming can be useful for &lt;strong&gt;structuring&lt;/strong&gt; material&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why people write code is to organize groups of related procedures and perform them in a consistent way in many different occasions. I can see this being useful in a geometry classroom, for example. Students could organize their knowledge of geometrical formulas by having classes containing functions used for computing perimeters, areas, and volumes. Also, the process of writing the actual functions is an exercise in helping students remember precisely what quantities are needed to calculate others. The way that students would end up using these functions is another source of excitement for people who code regularly. Students would use their library of geometry functions to solve more involved problems by creating an organized sequence of function calls to solve each step of the problem in sequence. Programmers love being able to clearly see the overall flow of a complex procedure as a sequence of smaller tasks. Essentially, the function-oriented nature of programming enables students to put &lt;a href=&#34;http://simplystatistics.org/2015/02/04/knowledge-units-the-atoms-of-statistical-education/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;knowledge units&lt;/a&gt; into a documented story-like framework, which hopefully would encourage big picture understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;technology-can-enrich-education-not-dumb-it-down&#34;&gt;Technology can enrich education, not &amp;ldquo;dumb it down&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mr. Wolfram’s big idea was to use programming to teach math, I think the main subtheme of his talk was the increased incorporation of technology in math classrooms. Not &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/ipads-in-the-classroom-worth-doing-right/d/d-id/1110490?&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;technology for technology’s sake&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; in terms of gadgets like &lt;a href=&#34;http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-smartboards-are-dumb-initiative.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Smartboards&lt;/a&gt; and iPads, but thoughtfully constructed, computer-oriented lesson-plans, assignments, and activities. Technology, when appropriately used, can enrich education, and I think that the main avenue for this is through simulation and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simulation can be an amazing activity for getting students to think about real-world applications of what they are learning. For example, a lot of the simulations provided on &lt;a href=&#34;http://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/simulations/examples.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; have to do with the very practical task of learning about economics and could quite feasibly fit into an algebra curriculum. Just covered equations of lines? Well how about reinforcing those concepts and showing their utility by exploring linear trends that pop up in economics? If it is not common already, simulations should be more seriously considered by educators as add-on exercises to enhance a curriculum. I find simulations appealing as a teaching tool because they allow students to quickly try lots of things, allowing them to see a wide variety of phenomena in a short span of time. Most importantly, this allows them to &lt;strong&gt;discuss&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;write&lt;/strong&gt; much more just because they have observed so much that they can comment on. Talking, and even more so writing due to its slower and more structured nature, is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED544239.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;great way&lt;/a&gt; to assess the extent to which students understand a topic, and if high quality writing is emphasized, it can really get students to internalize ideas. So in short, technology should be used as a means of facilitating a high volume of &lt;strong&gt;exploration&lt;/strong&gt; so as to facilitate more &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;discussion&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming can definitely enrich math education by helping students organize concepts and reinforce their understanding of the material. However, we still have to make sure that we motivate material and put it into a memorable context for students. Regarding the broader goal of increasing the presence of technology in education, expensive and ineffective approaches should be abandoned for activities that can be performed on computers and equipment already available in schools. Activities such as simulations can markedly deepen investigation of a topic and are easily performed with the materials available in most classrooms. Amending curricula to incorporate these ideas and activities might involve some time investment, but it could definitely improve the quality of student learning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adapting education style to improve relevance and practical skills</title>
      <link>/post/adapting-education-style/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2014 17:41:30 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/adapting-education-style/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my educational duties this past semester was as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate introductory biostatistics course. We went over the usual topics—calculating probabilities from tables, test statistics, hypothesis testing, linear and logistic regression—and I felt that the curriculum made a great effort to contextualize the material by organizing the content into goal-oriented modules. For example, linear regression was introduced as a tool for the specific goal of explaining college students’ GPA based on alcohol consumption-related characteristics. Whether or not the dataset that we gave to the students was the best source of information for investigating this relationship, I felt that there were two pedagogical ideas behind this module that were well implemented. First, the relationship being explored (I would guess) is one that piques the interest of a large percentage of the students. A lot of college students drink and almost everyone knows someone who drinks. It was great that the theme for this module was self-motivating. Second, the structure of the main assignment for the module forced students to write in a substantive way. The students had to come up with their own linear regression models to explore the relationship between GPA and drinking-related characteristics, and they were asked to write a report of their process, findings, and model interpretations—all things that are essential to understand when reading, writing, and discussing research findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to focus on these two teaching ideas for a bit and give my perspective on what we might need to do to adapt education for the future. Current events have precipitated a lot of intense and particularly emotion-backed discussion about racial injustice and inequality in general. From discussions with people much more knowledgeable and well-spoken than I am, I would have to say that perhaps the most essential asset that a lot of people don’t get from their education is an ability to think critically and argue rationally. These are hard things to do, and I think that school is the place to get people to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve explained in previous posts, case-based learning is a great way to motivate the concepts being taught in class so that students can see their practical uses and therefore remember the ideas for the long-term. In creating examples and giving context to classroom content, we need to think hard about what those examples will be. Perhaps the best way to really engage students and get them to care about what they’re learning is to use the most current issues possible. For example, I think that someone who decided to create a case-based statistics course for the current generation might have a lot of success using both news and research articles about social inequality. I think the key is to relate what is being presented in the news to what research has actually been performed and get students to closely examine the relationship between these sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational argumentation is another skill that is lacking in our generation. Very often we tend to talk to and become friends with like-minded people, and we are not as easily forced to question our views and see fallacies in the bases for our opinions. Forcing conversation in an educational setting is a great way to break that comfort zone because there is such a diversity of opinion. I love that the statistics course that I taught for emphasized writing because it forced students to at least put some words behind what they were learning. Just having those words is several steps above rote calculation and memorization in terms of really embedding meaning and understanding. But the way to truly make the most of those words is to construct them carefully to tell a story, to make a point. Words as a list of facts do little to reinforce understanding. To this end, I think that educators should elevate the role of writing to the level of speech and debate. I see this having great potential in mathematics and statistics classrooms. Throughout a statistics course we teach students about tools and the assumptions behind them that are used to draw conclusions from data. To truly assess their understanding of statistical concepts and to put these concepts in a meaningful context, perhaps one of the key assignments or activities of the course would be to read scientific papers and have a debate. In this way, we can prepare students for the types of discussions that they’ll have throughout their life by helping them recognize reasoning flaws in the arguments of others as well as their own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Motivating the question</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apathy is the cancer of today’s classroom. Once it plants its nasty little head in a student’s mind, it can be one tough beast to eradicate. Complaints like “I don’t care about this” and “When would I even use this?” are frighteningly common in higher education and indicate a malady far worse than boredom: time wasted. Not only are students wasting time being in class, cranking out hours of work to learn material that won’t be retained or appreciated, but teachers are also wasting their time preparing mechanical, need-agnostic material that will ultimately make no impact on their students’ interaction with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, the point of education is to learn how to live in this world—whether to learn specific skills for a job that will pay for our livelihoods or to learn ideas that shape how we react to the people, laws, and situations around us. And one of the most important ways in which education applies in real life is in being able to recognize when and how different concepts pertain to the situation at hand. Too often in classrooms are we given the punch line before the build-up. As education blogger Dan Meyer &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2014/developing-the-question-needs-improvement/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, teachers are too excited to present the concept without spending an adequate enough time &lt;em&gt;motivating&lt;/em&gt; the question behind the concept. And the result is a lack of internalization of ideas, a failure to understand why the material being taught is relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explained in my &lt;a href=&#34;../imp-perspectives&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP) puts in an admirable effort to motivate the need for mathematical concepts. It presents a tough multi-faceted problem at the beginning of each unit and develops the need for various math topics as it pertains to this overarching problem. I felt that one of the most memorable and instructive units was one in which we attempted to solve the unit problem on the very first day without any formal tools whatsoever. The best part (though frustrating at the time for me) was that this was &lt;em&gt;really hard&lt;/em&gt;. There is definitely something that can be said for having students try to do things inefficiently to learn the &lt;em&gt;merits&lt;/em&gt; of the concepts that teachers are so excited to get to. Or in Dan’s words, there is definitely something that can be said for &amp;ldquo;being less helpful&amp;rdquo;—not jumping straight to teaching students about power tools but momentarily convincing them that the logs on their desks can only be cut with butter knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introductory statistics courses can definitely benefit from a more problem-oriented and &amp;ldquo;less helpful&amp;rdquo; mentality. For one, I think there is a deluge of formulae for students to learn, and most of the time, the reasons for using them were never really developed or lost in the memorization process. The topic of confidence intervals serves as a great example here. We drill into students’ minds that the formula for a confidence interval is an estimate plus or minus some multiple of the standard error. And we can tell them that the interval gives us a range of possible values for the true population mean. But why are these possible values good ones? Why do we even have to give a confidence interval? Why isn’t it enough to just say that the mean is &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; 5, say? When do I ever see confidence intervals in real life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better way to teach this idea than to present a formula and give a two-minute interpretation is to make students see how the idea of a confidence interval is one they are exposed to frequently but in disguise. One way to do this is to present the students with common types of advertisement tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

These are definitely worth buying! But we can also think about what numbers on these ads would make us less convinced of the products&#39; worth. A cholesterol reduction of 0 to 1% would definitely not make me want to buy Cheerios. And I would be much less impressed by this Colgate toothpaste if 50% or less of doctors recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we give the students data—several sets of data that support or fail to substantiate the Cheerios claim to varying degrees—and ask them to make their own conclusions based on this data. I would expect many of them to take the average lowering of cholesterol as a summary measure; some might look at the median or mode; some might look at the percentage of people who had their cholesterol lowered by some minimal percentage level. No matter how they choose to look at the data the key idea is that the students see how their chosen summary measure(s) vary from dataset to dataset. Sometimes the claims in the ad are supported, and other times they are definitely not. It’s just that companies often only report their summary measures and not how much that measure would vary had they tested their product on different groups of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this point, I think that students would be a little more ready to learn about confidence intervals because they have seen how advertisements, something they encounter all the time, can use (or really conceal) them in misleading ways. And no one likes being duped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far not the best way of motivating confidence intervals, but it is a lot more than can be said for the majority of introductory statistics classes. Just taking a little bit more time to think about the everyday applications of statistics can go a long way in making lessons less formulaic and more engaging, and this is something that the statistics community should strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perspectives on the Interactive Mathematics Program</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My pre-college mathematics education was probably different from most others. Instead of adopting the standard approach of teaching Algebra I and II, Geometry, and Trigonometry, my school district took up the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), a problem-centric approach to learning the essential material from these subjects. The program was split into 4 courses, each the equivalent of a middle school year or high school semester, and each course was split into approximately 5 units. Each unit introduced a mathematically-oriented story, which gave rise to a guiding question that we sought to be able to answer over the course of the unit. For example, in the second year unit “Cookies”, we are introduced to the Woo’s, a family of bakers who wish to optimize their cookie baking choices to maximize their profits. The challenge though is that they have several constraints on their available ingredients and sales capabilities. Over the course of the unit, we learned several ideas related to systems of equations and inequalities that helped us answer this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn’t appreciate it at the time, IMP was attempting to do something that is rarely seen in education these days but is extremely important: motivating the concepts. At the beginning of the “Cookies” unit, I remember that class immediately started off with an attempt to solve the unit problem—no instruction on the best mathematical techniques, just a lot of pain, backtracking, and guesswork. I remember being overwhelmed just after organizing the information provided on the family’s ingredient and sales constraints. And guessing potential solutions was memorably laborious: does it work to make 100 chocolate chip and 170 oatmeal raisin? Rats! That violates constraint 4! What about 150 oatmeal raisin? Nice! That’s allowed! Aw shoot, that makes less money than my 150 chocolate chip, 130 oatmeal raisin combo! Fifty minutes of this and I was pulling my hair out. There must be an easier way to do this! And there was! Which we came to learn over the course of the next month or so that we spent on the unit. This particular unit sticks out in my memory primarily because it did such a good job at motivating the need for the main mathematical tools that we were learning during the unit. Had I taken a standard algebra course, I know I would not have truly internalized the utility of what we learned during that unit. For the most part, IMP did a decent job at contextualizing math concepts, and I think that this is a quality that is lacking in higher education in general. In designing curricula, we are not doing enough to motivate the content of the course, and I plan to explore this idea much further in a future post relating to introductory statistics curricula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of IMP that is particularly well suited to higher education is its emphasis on summarizing and organizing knowledge gained over the course of a unit. At the end of every unit, students are required to create a portfolio of reflections, class notes, and assignments that were instrumental in their comprehension of the main topics. So for example, in my “Cookies” portfolio, I included the first day of class activity that had us take a stab at the unit problem. I also included my class notes on feasible regions and solving systems of linear inequalities. I also wrote a cover letter summarizing the goals of the unit, what I learned from the assignments that I included in the portfolio, and my impressions of how these concepts were useful in everyday life. Portfolio time was always a laborious and dreadful experience for me during middle and high school, but I recognize now how useful a practice it is for being serious about retaining knowledge. As a graduate student, I have been exposed to several fundamental concepts time and time again in different courses, and I have found myself consciously wishing that I had put together portfolios for many of the classes that I took during college. Not only is the act of putting together a portfolio an invaluable synthesis activity, but the portfolio also serves as a one-of-a-kind reference manual. Because it is a collection of notes, homeworks, etc. created, curated, and edited by you, it can be infinitely more readable then a textbook. If you want it to, it can contain all of the steps in the proofs of key theorems, all of the exhaustive explanation that you worked through on your own, all of the fine details that finally made a concept click. A portfolio is a mini-textbook written in the language of your mind and can thus potentially serve as a reference for a very long time. It is a wonderful idea for IMP to introduce this concept to younger students, and I feel that it would be very useful for many high school and college classes to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So essentially the Interactive Mathematics Program, though by no means flawless, takes steps beyond traditional education practices that definitely have merit. Its case-based structuring of learning and its emphasis on creating concept portfolios can really impact the depth of learning and are ideas that nearly all higher education courses can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;
