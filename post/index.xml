      <description>Grading doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to suck—for teachers or for students. Two books on grading have inspired me to adopt a reinvigorated mindset towards grading and feedback: Specifications Grading by Linda Nilson and Grading for Equity by Joe Feldman.</description>

      <description>I love Dungeons and Dragons. I am also a data-loving statistician. At some point, these worlds were bound to collide.
For those unfamiliar with Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), it is a role-playing game that is backed by an extraodinary amount of data.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading The Book of Why by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, and I really enjoyed it. I had been wanting to read it for some time now because I know very little about methodology relating to causal diagrams and structure learning.</description>

      <title>Tips for using the Hugo academic theme</title>

      <description>I recently migrated my personal website and Wordpress blog to blogdown. As an academic, it was natural to use the Academic theme. The blogdown package made the conversion fairly straighforward, but I still had to spend some time figuring out how to work with this Hugo theme.</description>

      <description>I love Game of Thrones. I particularly liked this mini-speech from Petyr Baelish earlier in Season 7:
 Don’t fight in the North or the South. Fight every battle everywhere, always, in your mind.</description>

      <description>Creating a Shiny application that enables user login can be useful for tailoring individual user experience and for analyzing user actions with profile-type data. With basic file I/O functions, it is possible to create a simple but insecure app that stores login names and passwords in text files.</description>

      <description>I am currently a TA for an introductory biostatistics sequence at JHSPH where we teach students about the essentials of regression analysis. A great question that came up at office hours last week was, “What is likelihood?</description>

      <description>As per a friend’s suggestion, I watched Conrad Wolfram’s TED talk on reforming mathematics education. He advocates increased use of computers in the classroom and, in particular, champions the idea of teaching math via programming.</description>

      <description>Part of my educational duties this past semester was as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate introductory biostatistics course. We went over the usual topics—calculating probabilities from tables, test statistics, hypothesis testing, linear and logistic regression—and I felt that the curriculum made a great effort to contextualize the material by organizing the content into goal-oriented modules.</description>

      <description>Apathy is the cancer of today’s classroom. Once it plants its nasty little head in a student’s mind, it can be one tough beast to eradicate. Complaints like “I don’t care about this” and “When would I even use this?</description>

      <title>Perspectives on the Interactive Mathematics Program</title>

      <description>My pre-college mathematics education was probably different from most others. Instead of adopting the standard approach of teaching Algebra I and II, Geometry, and Trigonometry, my school district took up the Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP), a problem-centric approach to learning the essential material from these subjects.</description>

      <title>Why statistics can be scary</title>

      <description>I’ve been planning for some time to start this blog mainly as a way to give intuition to people untrained in statistics about what statisticians do and why. For the last few weeks, I’ve been gathering ideas, and I’ve found that in the process I’ve had to be a lot more reflective about fundamental aims in statistics that I had almost started taking for granted.</description>
